**Abstract:** Due to the non-degradable nature of heavy metals (HMs), the industrial effluent, whether treated or untreated, carrying HMs, eventually end up into the water bodies, soil, and sediments. Numerous countermeasures were applied, but the use of ornamental plants for the stress mitigation associated with HMs on the environment is a neglected research domain. The composition of wastewater influences bioremediation strategies. As the wastewater is contaminated with multiple HMs, many lab studies, with the plants, failed in the industrial field. This work focuses on the potential of Nicotiana alata L. and Petunia hydrida L. against multiple HMs contaminated synthetic wastewater. To improve plant tolerance, soil amendments (biochar, compost, and moss, each at 5% v/v in soil) were used, individually and in combination. After 6 weeks of the exposure, plant physiological, biochemical and enzymatic parameters, as well as the distribution of HMs, (Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Mn, Ni, and Zn) in the plant (flower, leaves, root, and shoot) and soil, were measured. The HMs uptake positivity influenced the malondialdehyde content, hydrogen peroxide content and electrolyte leakage, while negatively to photosynthetic pigments, and resulted in increased catalase, guaiacol peroxidase, glutathione s-transferase, ascorbate peroxidase, while reduced superoxide dismutase activity. It was found that all amendments improved the plant growth by metal stabilization, and best results were obtained with the combined application of biochar + compost + moss. So, HMs stabilization can be achieved by growing ornamental plants, like Nicotiana alata L. and Petunia hydrida L. along with soil amendments.
